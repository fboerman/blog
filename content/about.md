Hi my name is Frank and welcome to my blog! Something about me, I have a Msc in Electrical Engineering from the TU/e and live in Boxtel. I work at TenneT as a Flowbased capacity calculation expert and am mainly active in monitoring, reporting and helping design improvements of the CORE Flowbased processes. Sometimes I also do this for Day-ahead and Intraday markets.

As a hobby I like to run this website and read books, mainly about history. Next to that I like walking in nature and cudling my fiance and cats. I also like to help people digest complex topics through intuitive visualization.

I run a public grafana dashboard [here](https://data.boerman.dev/) and a public reports system about CORE [here](https://reports.coreflowbased.eu).

You can find my linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-boerman-477613164/) and my CV [here](/CVFrankBoerman.pdf). I also have a github profile on which I publish multiple open source projects [here](https://github.com/fboerman). You can reach me either at linkedin or through mail at [frank@fboerman.nl](mailto:frank@fboerman.nl). I also do some consulting on the side to help people with analysis and visualizations, more info [here](https://amunanalytics.eu/).
