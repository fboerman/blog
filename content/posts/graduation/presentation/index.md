# Graduated!
After long months of work, today I finished my graduation project with a 7.5! That means I am now a graduated msc Electrical Engineering. Many thanks to Kees van Berkel and Marc Geilen for their supervising work!

Due to the corona crisis the presentation was done fully online through microsoft teams. I have made a recording of the 30 min presentation, links to all material can be found below. I will finish my blog parts about my graduation project somewhere in the future, but first I am going to enjoy a holiday over the summer.
