Disclaimer: This post is a bit more in depth policy then my normal ones. If you are not interested in the 70% rule then do not bother with this post. Since I work a lot with this rule in my work at TenneT I found it interesting to do a deep dive. I have tried to make it accesible even if you havent encounter this rule before but are still interested in capacity calculation regulation.  
As always comments and thoughts are always welcome! Either at my social media or via email.

## The 70% Rule
(Note: experts can skip this part and go to the summary of the ruling)  
Since the clean energy package (CEP) there is a obligation for TSO's to provide at least 70% of capacity on Critical Network Elements (CNEs) for cross-zonal trade. Not every TSO could provide this from the start and thus two options were given to still be considered compliant.  
For structural issues an action plan can be defined, which is a linear trajectory towards the 70%, with an increasing yearly target until the 70% is reached.  
For temporary issues which do not fit under this, a derogation can be applied. A derogation allows a TSO to make available less then 70% in order to maintain operational security.
The idea is that the issues underlying an action plan or derogation are being worked to achieve the 70% given a certain roadmap.  
In Europe some TSO's have an action plan, some have a derogation and some have both. For example TenneT TSO B.V. where I work has an action plan (or linear trajectory) while we are working on grid investments. But we also have a derogation to lower the target for situations of excessive loop flows that endanger operation security otherwise.

## Introduction
The ACER decision that I am writing about today is the first of its kind as far as I know. Although many action plans and derogations were submitted, this is the first time that border NRA's formally disagreed with granting them by the applicable NRA. According to regulation the decision is then referred to the European regulator ACER.  
This is very interesting because it means that for the first time ACER lays down its opinion on several details of the concept of derogation. In my opinion this constitutes a form of established case law for further discussions surrounding derogations specifically and the 70% rule in general.  
This post is a summary and personal analysis of the events that led up to this decision and, most importantly, the decision itself.  
The decision can be found on the website of ACER [here](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Individual%20Decisions/ACER%20Decision%2017-2022%20on%20Svenska%20kraftn%C3%A4t%E2%80%99s%20request%20for%20a%20derogation%20from%20the%2070%25%20requirement.pdf).

## Disclaimer
Please note that this post is my own thoughts and does not constitute any official position of TenneT TSO B.V. I will not express an opinion on wether this decision is right or not. The decision from ACER is clear and is supported by multiple stakeholders and NRA's, I think that speaks for itself. It is up to SvK to appeal if they disagree and let it be handled by the appropriate authorities.

## The Swedish Derogation
On 6 October 2021 the Swedish TSO Svenska kraftn√§t (SvK) applied for a derogation with their National Regulating Agency (NRA) the Energy Market Inspectorate (Ei). They did this for multiple bidding zones borders, both external and internal to Sweden. During the formal process of approval that followed the Finnish NRA (EV) and the Danish NRA (DUR) stated their formal opposition to granting a derogation on any border.  
After already striking down derogation on some borders, and being neutral on one (NO1-SE3), Ei then referred the case for the remaining borders to ACER. In table 1 below the borders and their situation leading up to the decision are listed.

Below for each relevant party its arguments are summarized if they were put in the ACER decision. Since only two borders were referred to ACER the arguments will mainly revolved around them specifically.

## SvK reasoning behind the derogation request
The reason for needing a derogation boils down to a lack of Remedial Actions (RAs) to meet the 70% requirement without endangering operational security. SvK points to different scenarios (or corridors) in which there is high congestion. If there is not enough RAs to mediate this, the only way to have a safe operation is to lower capacities on the bidding zone borders. This then makes them unable to meet the 70%.  
Some of these corridors were already there historically and some are new due to taking some big generators offline (in this case nuclear plants) as well as a new interconnectivity (and their resulting flows) between Scandinavia and the European mainland.  
Interestingly SvK called these challenges structural congestions in their original filing. However later they changed this to being occasional contestions congestions and they also reiterated that again before ACER. This is an important detail later.

## Arguments of DUR to oppose derogation
Their arguments fall in two categories, specifically naming details of the request and making more general arguments.  
Specifically they point out that capacity reductions on Swedish interconnectors, specifically DK1-SE3 has been an issue for more then 10 years. SvK has failed in their eyes to develop any remedies for this over this period and their application of available RA was insufficient. This is even more apparent in their eyes due to the fact that for 2021 there was already a derogation granted and nothing was done to remedy the situation. So granting a derogation seems to have not properly incentivized SvK.  
More generally they stress that 70% should be applied to all bidding zone borders, not only the ones that align with country borders. This as specific response to Ei denying this.  
Procedurally they also believe that regulation states that no more then two derogations can be granted in succession. Since SvK already got a derogation for 2020 and 2021, 2022 should not be possible on procedural grounds. Secondly they argue that SvK seems to show that the underlying issues are structural, while a derogation is for temporary issues. Structural congestions should be dealt with by a long term action plan and/or possible bidding zone reconfigurations, not a derogation.
