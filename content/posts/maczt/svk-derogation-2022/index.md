Disclaimer: This post is a bit more in depth policy then my normal ones. If you are not interested in the 70% rule then do not bother with this post. Since I work a lot with this rule in my work at TenneT I found it interesting to do a deep dive. I have tried to make it accessible even if you haven't encounter this rule before but are still interested in capacity calculation regulation. I have added explanations and interpretations through out the text, which are solely my own.    
As always comments and thoughts are welcome! Either at my social media or via email (for this subject please use frank.boerman@tennet.eu).

## The 70% Rule
(Note: experts can skip this part and go to the summary of the ruling)  
Since the clean energy package (CEP)came into force there is a obligation for TSO's to provide at least 70% of capacity on Critical Network Elements (CNEs) for cross-zonal trade.The percentage of capacity release is also called Margin Cross Zonal Trade or MACZT. Not every TSO could provide this from the start and thus two options were given to still be considered compliant.  
For structural issues an action plan can be defined, which is a linear trajectory towards the 70%, with an increasing yearly target until the 70% is reached.  
For temporary issues which do not fit under this, a derogation can be applied. A derogation allows a TSO to make available less then 70% in order to maintain operational security.
The idea is that the issues underlying an action plan or derogation are being worked on to achieve the 70% given a certain roadmap for the duration of said derogation or actionplan.  
In Europe some TSO's have an action plan, some have a derogation and some have both. For example TenneT TSO B.V. where I work has an action plan (or linear trajectory) while we are working on grid investments. But we also have a derogation to lower the target for situations of excessive loop flows that endanger operation security otherwise. These loop flows are investigated to be resolved in the Bidding Zone Review (BZR).

## Introduction
The ACER decision that I am writing about today is the first of its kind as far as I know. Although many action plans and derogation's were submitted, this is the first time that border NRA's formally disagreed with granting them by the applicable NRA. According to regulation the decision is then referred to the European regulator ACER.  
This is very interesting because it means that for the first time ACER lays down its opinion on several details of the concept of derogation. In my opinion this constitutes a form of established case law for further discussions surrounding derogation's specifically and the 70% rule in general.  
This post is a summary and personal analysis of the events that led up to this decision and, most importantly, the decision itself.  
The decision can be found on the website of ACER [here](https://www.acer.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Individual%20Decisions/ACER%20Decision%2017-2022%20on%20Svenska%20kraftn%C3%A4t%E2%80%99s%20request%20for%20a%20derogation%20from%20the%2070%25%20requirement.pdf).

## Disclaimer
Please note that this post is my own thoughts and does not constitute any official position of TenneT TSO B.V. I will not express an opinion on whether this decision is right or not. The decision from ACER is clear and is supported by multiple stakeholders and NRA's, I think that speaks for itself. It is up to SvK to appeal if they disagree and let it be handled by the appropriate authorities.

## The Swedish Derogation
On 6 October 2021 the Swedish TSO Svenska kraftn√§t (SvK) applied for a derogation with their National Regulating Agency (NRA) the Energy Market Inspectorate (Ei). They did this for multiple bidding zones borders, both external and internal to Sweden. During the formal process of approval that followed the Finnish NRA (EV) and the Danish NRA (DUR) stated their formal opposition to granting a derogation on any border.  
After already striking down derogation on some borders, and being neutral on one (NO1-SE3), Ei then referred the case for the remaining borders to ACER. In table 1 below the borders and their situation leading up to the decision are listed.

</figure>

Since only two borders were referred to ACER the arguments will mainly revolved around them specifically.

## SvK reasoning behind the derogation request
The reason for needing a derogation boils down to a lack of Remedial Actions (RAs) to meet the 70% requirement without endangering operational security. SvK points to different scenarios (or corridors) in which there is high congestion. If there is not enough RAs to mediate this, the only way to have a safe operation is to lower capacities on the bidding zone borders. This then makes them unable to meet the 70%.  
Some of these corridors were already there historically and some are new due to taking some big generators offline (in this case nuclear plants) as well as a new interconnectivity (and their resulting flows) between Scandinavia and the European mainland.  
Interestingly SvK called these challenges structural congestions in their original filing. However later they changed this to being occasional congestions and they also reiterated that again before ACER. This is an important detail later.

## Arguments of Danish (DUR) and Finish (EV) NRA's to oppose derogation
Although filed separately, the oppositions of DUR and EV have similarities, so they are here summarized together.  
Their arguments fall in two categories, specifically naming details of the request and making more general arguments.  


Specifically they point out that capacity reductions on Swedish interconnectors, specifically DK1-SE3 has been an issue for more then 10 years. SvK has failed in their eyes to develop any remedies for this over this period and their application of available RA was insufficient. In fact they think that there was and is sufficient RA, but that SvK does not enable it correctly. This is even more apparent in their eyes due to the fact that for 2021 there was already a derogation granted and nothing was done to remedy the situation. So granting a derogation seems to have not properly incentivized SvK. For the finish border EV also claims that the finish border situation that SvK points to as a justification for the derogation, already existed in 2021, while no derogation was requested then.

  
More generally DUR stresses that the 70% should be applied to all bidding zone borders, not only the ones that align with country borders. This as a specific response to Ei denying this. This has been a discussion point for as long as the 70% rule has existed. It revolves around the wording of what constitutes an interconnector in the regulation. Since most bidding zone borders align with country borders the discussion was mostly theoretical. However with Sweden being one of the exceptions (although in the Nordics its much more common) this point is now heavily debated.    
DUR also believes procedurally that regulation states that no more then two derogations can be granted in succession. Since SvK already got a derogation for 2020 and 2021, 2022 should not be possible on procedural grounds.  
Both argue that SvK seems to show that the underlying issues are structural, while a derogation is for temporary issues. Structural congestions should be dealt with by a long term action plan and/or possible bidding zone reconfigurations, not a derogation. This is indeed more in line with how other member states usually tackle this. An action plan is in place for multiple TSO's, for example the ones in NL and DE. There is also a Bidding Zone Review (BZR) going on in which SvK participates and will investigate strong changes to its bidding zone configuration.


Another point of criticism is that there is no long term plan to bring improvements. The whole point of action plans and derogations is that a TSO gets time to bring their affairs in order, there is no permanent exception to the 70% possible. But the SvK derogation does not seem to show such a plan. On top of that there is no plan or guarantees to ensure only a minimal breach of the 70% is done to ensure operational security. In other words SvK could use the derogation to curtail a lot more capacity then would strictly be necessary. This seems related to (later mentioned) criticism about transparency and data publication of SvK in general. A lot of their message seems to be "trust us on this" while the NRA's would like some more firm guarantees and after-the-fact checking.

Lastly EV harshly criticizes the analysis underlying the request, they call the quality and relevance of both data and analysis "questionable". This also comes back later in the decision document as written by ACER. SvK was unable to deliver certain necessary data and the ones they delivered were usually anonymized to such a degree that it becomes unusable. Again this touches the point of transparency and data publication, that almost all stakeholders find lacking of SvK.

Overall the criticism is broad, they are essentially claiming that SvK did not do its work enough, both in terms of procuring and executing RA in the past as well as showing that they have a legitimate shortage now.  

## Original ruling of Swedish NRA Ei
In the original ruling of Ei to deny all but two of the requested borders Ei seems to agree with its sister NRA's in the sense that they largely use the same arguments for those borders. They state that SvK cannot properly prove that there is indeed not sufficient RA to maintain operational security. However they are also of the opinion that interconnectors between internal bidding zones do not count for the 70% in the first place, something disputed by DUR.  
Interestingly Ei also points out that the previous granted derogation of 2021 was not actually used by SvK in that year, further proving that the claimed lack of RA is not really the case.  
Ei also comments on the data quality as having gaps, but they state that it was still sufficiently complete enough to use it.

## Comments of other stake holders
As part of the public consultation of ACER, multiple (market) stake holders wrote opinions and/or expressed it in dedicated workshops and meetings with ACER.  
Interestingly no stake holder supports SvK in granting the derogation, with the vast majority openly opposing it and others being more neutral with some critical comments.  Their comments are very similar to those of the NRAs, so will not be repeated here.  
Neighboring TSO's were asked for input, in which the Finish one echod the statement that SvK actually needs an actionplan and roadmap instead of derogation. The Danish one echos that SvK did not do enough to procure enough RA, adding that SvK has no proper tools to monitor the 70% in the first place. The Norwegian TSO adds that they think SvK are very non-transparant and thus hard to check what they are actually doing. This is also stressed by market parties.


Implicitly, in my opinion, it can be read in the objections of stakeholders that they have been concerned about SvK behavior on this topic for some time. The NRAs seem to have chosen this derogation to finally put their foot down. Other stakeholders then joined (legally only NRAs can file objections to a derogation). DUR even explicitly mentions that capacity curtailment has been a problem for years.  
The topic about transparancy and data publication also comes back throughout comments of stakeholders, as well as ACER. Even the Swedish NRA Ei touches upon the problems with this. Although it is not SvKs fault that there much of TSO data is classified as national security in Sweden, many stakeholders seem to feel that they can at least be more transparant in their procedures. As we will see later in the final ruling of ACER, non transparency, or flat out omission, of procedural descriptions is being levied as grounds to deny the derogation. I would not be surprised if that will happen again in the future.


## ACER findings: Preliminary remarks
Before beginning to lay out their analysis and final ruling, ACER makes some preliminary remarks to frame their story. In these remarks some "mini rulings" can be found on how ACER interprets some regulation surrounding the 70% rule. In my opinion these can be used as kind of "case law" for further discussions surrounding the 70% topic.

First ACER clarifies that it agrees with DUR and EV in that a derogation is for, and only for, temporary issues. Structural congestions need to be solved by an actionplan and/or a review of bidding zone configuration. Hence it was very important that SvK changed its initial wording that the issues they identified are temporary only. Only then a derogation can be considered. This is a clear statement on what is applicable for what. Extra note: SvK is active in the current bidding zone review and the swedish configuration is actively being investigated with radical changes being reviewed.

Second ACER constructs a clear legal argument that the 70% rule needs to be applied to all bidding zone borders. In fact it is laid out that a country border has no legal connection at all to a bidding zone border and vice versa. The word interconnector applies to a connection between a bidding zone, regardless of the type of bidding zone, according to ACER.This is in clear disagreement with Ei and should settle a long running debate (mainly relevant in the Nordics) on this.

Third, in capacity calculation there are two types of maximum limits of an element. The temporary limit (TATL) is a flow that an element can sustain for a short (usually 15 min) time safely. A lower permanent limit (PATL) an element can sustain indefinitely. It has been the convention in both the Nordics as well as continental Europe that for the 70% rule the PATL should be used. ACER now confirms that it agrees with this approach and uses it itself in its analysis.

Fourth ACER agrees with stakeholders and other TSO's that more transparency is needed in order to properly assess the 70% rule. SvK has only provided a subset of requested data, both to ACER as well as their own NRA Ei. This data has gaps, partly due to SvK claiming it is a lot of manual work to fix and partly due to national security rules that SvK claims prohibits them to hand over the data. For example some constraints are simply listed as "CNEC 1" with no information on where the CNEC is physically located.

## ACER data analysis
ACER has tried to form an image of the achieved capacity that was released for cross zonal trade (MACZT) under the 70% rule. However in order to properly calculate this a definition of the capacity calculation region (CCR) needs to be defined in the context of the elements being looked at. SvK stated that this area is not static over time but could not provide more precise information or data on this. Another problem with the data was that in NTC capacity calculation only the data of the limiting CNEC is known. This in contrast with the Flowbased capacity calculation in which for each CNEC the MACZT is calculated at any moment of time.  
On top of this SvK was unable to provide all the data for the requested time period.2% of timestamps was fully missing, 11% had missing PTDF values. These timestamps were filtered out in the ACER analysis. The data it did provide was anonymized, so some sanity checking of the data was impossible.  
Because of the above ACER had to make some assumptions and actually calculated multiple CCR scenarios and then took the average over them to be used in the conclusion.

After these assumption setups and calculations ACER finds the following statistics for two periods that were provided. These periods were from 2021-03-01 until 2021-12-31 (2021) and from 2022-01-01 until 2022-06-18 (2022).

<figure class="left" style="width:100%">

|                                | 2021 | 2022 |
|--------------------------------|------|------|
| % MTU not met 70%              | 20%  | 29%  |
| average % MACZT                | 84%  | 75%  |
| average % MACZT in hours < 70% | 57%  | 58%  |

<figcaption class="center">Table 2: statistics from analysis ACER</figcaption>
</figure>

On top of these results, ACER also looked at the correlation between the outage of two large nuclear units with the MACZT, since SvK has brought this as an argument of not being able to meet the 70%. Although there seems to be a partially linkage, it cannot be the sole reason for lower MACZT according to ACER, since there are many timestamps in which the MACZT is low with no outage of said generators.

## ACER conclusions and verdict of the derogation request
ACER has tested the derogation request to the formal separate criteria of the relevant regulation. Their findings can be summarized as follows.  

First, and most importantly, ACER finds that SvK has not shown that there is a large enough shortage of RA to make a derogation necessary. The burden of proof for this is on SvK and they did not support their claims with enough data and analysis to make it seem true.  
 The missing volumes to make the 70% are not very high as shown in table 2 and should be doable with RA. ACER takes the comments made by the vast majority of stakeholders about the quality and efforts for arranging RA into account here.   
This is a clear reproof of SvK efforts and a take down of the corner stone of the request. The remark about the low missing volumes can be implicitly read as a hint to arrange an action plan with linear trajectory instead. This would be in line with how continental Europe tackles the 70% for the next couple of years.  
On top of that ACER notes that in its view issues for only a couple hours is not enough to justify a derogation for a whole year. There are emergency procedures in place to cite net safety and execute curtailments for such edge cases. In this they confirm what was already stated by the german NRA BNetzA in the past and as comment as a stakeholder.  

Second ACER finds the derogation request much too broad. SvK has no plan at all on how to limit its interventions to the minimum necessary to maintain operational security. There is no methodology description or any specifics about how they would try this. According to ACER this is compulsory from regulation and this another reason to reject the derogation. On this they thus fully agree with DUR and EV who already pointed this out.

Thirdly ACER disagrees with DUR about the duration and repeating of derogations and finds that it is allowed to repeat more then 2 times. The only requirement is that a derogation is no more then two years long at a time.   
This is actually another "mini ruling" in itself, since in continental Europe a repeating derogation for multiple years is already a thing in some countries.   

Fourth and finally ACER notes that SvK also has no plan on how to tackle non-discrimination. In other words if it curtails border capacities below 70% under the derogation it cannot say how it will distribute it equally to all borders, internally and externally. SvK does promise that it will not discriminate but does not specify how. This is another requirement from regulation and another reason in itself to reject the derogation.

So after all of the above statements ACER finds that it rejects the derogation request of SvK for 2022.

## Wrap up
Overall this decision is very interesting. It is the first of its kind and it contains not only a clear ruling on the Swedish situation, but also many clarifications and "mini rulings" in itself about the 70% rule. This can be helpful to other TSO's and NRA's as well and I hope all of them read it with interest. If you have any questions, comments or want to discuss about this ruling, my mailbox at TenneT is always open at frank.boerman@tennet.eu.   
Since it is explicitly part of my work at TenneT I do not accept business inquiries for this subject.
