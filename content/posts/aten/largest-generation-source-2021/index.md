When I talk to friends and family about the electricitymarket, they often do not realise the large reliance of the electricity market on gas. This inspired me to look at 2021 electricity production sources.  
The plot below shows largest electricity source per hour in the Netherlands (sources are color coded over time; days at the x-axis and hours at the y-axis).  
This plot makes evident the market's reliance on gas (i.e. yellow = gas). It also highlights the market's shift towards renewables sources (i.e dark green = wind; dark blue = solar).  
Time of the day and seasons also seem to influence the usage of energy sources. It is evident that day time electricity generation in summer time is largely powered by Solar energy. That can be seen by the nice block of blue for Solar energy at the middle of the day.  
The effect of increased coal usage (light blue) due to high market prices in the second half of the year during is also visible, with it being the dominating power sources at night.  
What do you think, how long will we keep being reliant on gas?

Color legend:  
Light green: biomass  
Yellow: gas  
Light blue: coal  
Orange: nuclear  
Red: other  
Dark blue: solar  
Pink: WKK (greenhouses)  
Dark purple: wastepower  
Dark green: wind (onshore + offshore)  

source: data from co2monitor.nl, "Wind" here is onshore and offshore combined.
