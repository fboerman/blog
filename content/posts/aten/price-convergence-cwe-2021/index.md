### What is price convergence?
The electricity market in Europe is split into so-called bidding zones. The rule is that within these zones you can trade without transport restrictions, as if the entire grid there is one big conducting plate. This also means that for the day ahead marketi, there is one price per hour per bidding zone. If neighbouring bidding zones have enough interconnection capacity available to satisfy the market direction, then the price in those zones will converge: it will be the same. So, price convergence can be seen as a measure on how much transport restriction the market has run into between bidding zones.
### The figure explained
The above plot shows the price convergence per day in the Central Western European (CWE) region, which consists of NL BE DE FR and AT.  
It is calculated by subtracting the minimum price from the maximum price  to get a price delta for each hour. Then this delta is categorized in bins such as between 0 and 1 euro, 1 and 2 euro difference etc. The bins are colour coded, going from dark green at full price convergence (d=0) to dark red for high non convergence (d>50 euro). The bins with corresponding colours are shown at the bottom of the figure. This is then shown in a bar chart in which the 24 hours in a day form 100% of the bar.  

The current market developments of high prices and high volatility also has an effect on the price convergence. As can be seen the last two months there is a high percentage of high non convergence. Which raises an interesting question, is this a temporary unique situation due to high fuel prices, or does it show shortcomings in the current market design?
